TODO Comment code
TODO Optimize code
TODO Verify that the image is slicing and repeating in the correct place. Sometimes
	a single pixel overlap will go unnoticed
TODO Test multiple images on the same screen
TODO Load/speed test
TODO Remove jQuery dependence
TODO Make more cross-browser compatible (is that even possible in IE?)
TODO? Add support for the padding box?
